########Partial F Test for Variable Selection in Linear Regression########################
#lets say we have a model predicting LungCap with Age
#the reduced model does not have Age^2 Let's compare the two
#does removing Age^2 decrease the error?

#null is the models do not differ significantly
#larger the test statistic, the larger the difference between two models' SSE

#load in the LungCapData, either from R or from Computer

#full model
FullModel<-lm(LungCap~Age+I(Age^2))
#reduced model
reducedmodel<-lm(LungCap~Age)

#summary
summary(FullModel)
#R^2 of .6727 and Residual Standard Error of 1.525
summary(reducedmodel)
#R^2 of .6719 and RSE of 1.526

#partial F Test
anova(reducedmodel, FullModel)
#p-valye us 0.172 so we fail to reject the null hypothesis 
#so we dont have evidence full model is signifcantly better

#another example, where we have Age, Height, Gender, Smokers in Full and we drop Height in Reduced
FullModel2<-lm(LungCap~Age+Gender+Smoke+Height)
reducedmodel2<-lm(LungCap~Age+Gender+Smoke)

anova(reducedmodel2, FullModel2)
#reject the null since p-value is much lower so the Full Model is significantly better (it also has lower SSE/RSS)
